Python code for 2D fem simulations.
All simulations have been carried out using the open source software fenics (2019 stable version). 
Main output files are in xdmf format and are not included (too large). The raw output files have been post-processed using the open source software paraview. We used paraview's internal functions to export data as csv files.
